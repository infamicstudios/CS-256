# Topic #1 Building ADT's ( discussion of programming assignment #1)
## What is an abstract data type
Code that solves problems using data abstraction. (Breaking code down into component classes that have their own responsibilities and use them eventually to solve significant problems)

public classes public and anything oulis anything in the client section. 


## **APPLYING RECURSION TO A PROBLEM:**
1. What is the base case
2. What do we want to do in this particular function invocation
3. How do we get to the next smaller subproblem?
4. Anything to be done after the recursive call?
5. What is being returned? -double check-

Example:
Recursion Activities
Display just the last node in a linear Linked list
What should be done the base case
how to go to the next small subproblem

```c
node * head = nullptr;
build(head);
int display_last(node * head);
