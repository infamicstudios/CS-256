# **Abstract Data Types and Linear Linked Lists**

## **C++ Paradigms**:
---
### **Procedural Abstraction:**
Code that can take parameters and handle various forms of situations depending on data input.

*(Small Fuctions meaningful goals.)* 
### **Modular Abstraction:**
Multiple files to solve problems.

### **Data Abstraction**
Creating data types to work with input and handle and allocate memory as implemented using internal methods.

*(Class that manages itself using internal methods to allocate memory)*

### **Object Oriented Programming**
Team of classes (5+ classes) that work together to solve a problem. (Important to avoid meandering).
 
## What is an ADT?
---
Abstract Data types hides how memory is worked with inside of a class.
